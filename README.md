# StackIt v1 - Minecraft 1.7-1.11 (ALPHA)
## A Powerful Shop for Minecraft.

This is the main repository for the stackit-server plugin for Bukkit/Spigot 1.7-1.11.
(BungeeCord are not yet supported, but are coming soon)

THIS PLUGIN IS IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. I WILL NOT BE HOLD RESPONSABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE DONE TO YOUR SERVER OR YOUR INFRASTRUCTURES. (SSL not included in the present build).

### What does this plugin do?
This plugin open a webserver and create a API for the StackIt CMS (Upcoming 2017).

### I want to add functionnalities to this plugin.
How awesome is that! Fortunally, StackIt server includes an API that allow you to create new types of purchase (Ex.: roles, permissions, etc.), add database type and create new context on the webserver.

A complete documentation is available at https://stackit.cf/docs/. (Currently in development)

### This plugin doesn't work!
If you are a server administrator, please use the StackIt CMS in order to use the full functionalities of the plugin. Without it, the plugin won't do anything, as it is not a standalone system.

If you are a developer, please report the errors you encounter in this repository.

#### All credits goes to Simon Hamelin for the development of this plugin.
